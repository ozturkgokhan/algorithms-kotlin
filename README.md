# Algorithms w/ Kotlin

This repo is all about some practice for myself. Altough most of those algos are being implemented all around the web such as leetcode, there may be some algos which are not there or maybe there are someone out there who are not still aware of leetcode like resources. There will be git repos for a few more languages, but this one is for Kotlin. I have seperated them to different repos to obtain conflicts with different IDEs etc.

I will also try to implement unit tests for each language I am putting onto the table. At least the happy paths. **Maybe this part may have a chance for colloboration -> Extending the unit tests with edge cases etc.**

This repo is not for interview preperation, or trying to make another data mess around. Just for fun and practice.
